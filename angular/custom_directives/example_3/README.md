EXAMPLE 3: 

	MULTIPLE DIRECTIVES:
	In this example we will go deeper into directives and scopes.

	Since a directive can be an element or an attribute, we know we can have more than one directive on an element. The problem can be both directives can ask for the same scope.

	However, don't try to create multiple directives requesting for same scope.


	INHERITED SCOPE
	ISOLATED SCOPE
